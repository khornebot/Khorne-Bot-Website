        <!--<p id="history">
          Khorne Bot started as a small tampermonkey script midi player bot that I messed around with on this mess of a <a href="https://www.multiplayerpiano.com">website</a> called MPP, this script is what got me into coding and where I learned a lot of my basic JS skills. Later on I moved away from using the tampermonkey script and made it a completely independent client, hosting it on <a href="https://www.glitch.com">Glitch</a> and slowly adding to it. Over the course of a few months, MPP would get sold off and die out, iFraming to <a href="https://mppclone.com">mppclone</a>. Here is where my focus on the bot would begin to die out, not being able to reliably access mppclone I took the code off of glitch, stashed it in a github repo, and left it. Bearly touching the mess of code that it was as I had left it in the middle of v2 which was going to bring the bot to discord. 9 months pass and in December of 2021 I suddenly felt the need to finish v2 and get the bot back up. In January of 2022 the bot was brought back to life on discord, since then I have been consistantly working on the bot, improving it and fixing bugs. v3.0.0 was released on 3/11/2022. Currnetly the bot is on v3.0.1.
